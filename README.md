# React Native: Accessing Uninitialized State Variable

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized.  The error often occurs when asynchronous operations (like data fetching) haven't completed before the component attempts to use the state.

The `UninitializedStateBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `UninitializedStateSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## Problem
Attempting to access a state variable (e.g., `userData`) before it's populated from an asynchronous operation can lead to undefined behavior and application crashes.

## Solution
The solution involves conditionally rendering content based on whether the data has been fetched.  You can achieve this using a loading indicator or by only rendering content after the state has been initialized.
