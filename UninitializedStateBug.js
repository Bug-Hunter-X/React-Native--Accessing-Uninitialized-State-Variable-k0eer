This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when a component renders before the asynchronous data fetching has completed. In functional components using useState, the state is initialized only when the component first renders. Therefore, accessing the state variable within the render phase before the state is initialized will cause an error.
